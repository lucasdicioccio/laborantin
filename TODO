new data structure:
  in config files (both env and scenarii):
    reference every rundir
    reference the class type
    reference the success/failure status (not in scenarii for now)
    reference the date (not in env for now, badly done for scenarii)
  reference the laborantin version somewhere
  relax 1sec constraint for uniqueness with an ID field instead
  make such that load / save methods pass through an adapter (database)
  migrate command that will take a legacy dir and make a new one from it by loading the old way; fixing the data model; saving in the new way
commands:
	report 
	publish
config dir:
	extra libraries to require
	publication configuration
general:
	move runner into core
	move runner/commands in another directory (e.g. /commands or /base/commands or /core/commands)
	roles
	better git/other SCM integration
